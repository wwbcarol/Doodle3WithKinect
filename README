Our project is based on Martin Schneider's work Doodle3(http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/6742).
In Martin's work, he uses Perlin Noise to create a hair flow kind of effect with mouse. His project
is based on Processing IDE(http://www.processing.org/) and basically is Java Applet.

We modified his code with different color scheme, repleced the original mouse interaction with Kinect.
We are using SimpleOpenNI library(https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/) to handle the Kinect part.
We are using Eclipse with processing library, check here about how to setup(http://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/).

How to run the project:
1. Install Kinect drivers. We recommend using Kinect XBOX (we have not test with Kinect for Windows).

2. Download Eclipse and import our project.
3. Plugin your Kinect.
4. Run the program, wave or raise your hand for detection, move your hand to draw.
